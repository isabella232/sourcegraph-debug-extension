# Debug extension

Helps debug Sourcegraph extensions.

## Why?

Use this extension to determine whether a bug is coming from the extensions you
are using or Sourcegraph's code.

## What?

This extension simply displays the version of Sourcegraph you are connected to
in the hover tooltip and after the line you are hovering. This allows us to test
network request, adding hover tooltip information and adding decorations to the
DOM.
